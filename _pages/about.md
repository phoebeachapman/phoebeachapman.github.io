I'm an ecologist and research scientist currently working as a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Otago's Department of Marine Science (New Zealand). I have a wide-ranging interest in wildlife, pathogens, invasive species, genomics, diagnostics, and all things in between.

Originally hailing from Australia, I attained my undergraduate degree from the University of Queensland (Bachelor of Science with majors in Zoology and Marine Biology; awarded Dean's Commendation for High Achievement) with a research Honours year in freshwater pest fish ecology. I completed my PhD in UQ's School of Veterinary Science, investigating the molecular diversity, pathology and diagnosis of parasites causing mortality in sea turtle populations. I also have a Graduate Certificate in GIS (Geographic Information Science; awarded with Distinction) from Curtin University, Western Australia.

Research
======
Since moving to New Zealand, I've spent several years working on a Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden-funded project in the Beck lab (Department of Zoology, University of Otago) exploring the role of bacterial microbiomes in enabling their host (the African clawed frog - <i>Xenopus laevis</i>) to regenerate tissue. I've since moved to the Fraser lab (Department of Marine Science) where I currently work on a variety of interesting projects using genetic and genomic data to investigate problems in the marine environments of New Zealand, the sub-Antarctic, and Antarctica. These include tracking kelp microbiomes in the sub-Antarctic and Antarctic regions, kelp recolonisation after heatwave-associated die-offs, and diagnosis of parasitic infections in kororƒÅ (little/blue penguins).

I have skills and extensive training in bioinformatics, with advanced programming ability in R as well as experience and training in Bash, Python and SQL to complement well-developed analytic and statistics skills. Please check out the 'Coding' section of this website for some examples of my work - I especially enjoy data visualisation! I am experienced in using sequencing data (both Sanger and high throughput/next generation) to assess diversity and relationships of various taxa, characterise microbial communities, and design assays. In the wet lab, I have considerable expertise in all techniques associated with genetics including DNA extraction, PCR, library prep, CRISPR, and primer/assay design. In addition, I have a background in ecological consulting which brings a number of additional skills in project and budget management, reporting, field surveys, and communication/negotiation.

Other Interests
======
On the weekends and holidays, I can usually be found outside. My wife and I are keen hikers and skiiers depending on the season, and New Zealand provides many ridiculously good-looking places to explore! I enjoy visiting the local bouldering gym before work, and was also a keen SCUBA diver - when I lived in a warmer climate :) In my younger years I was a keen competitive horse-rider, and still have a few old-timer equines enjoying retirement back home in Australia. Unlike our cat, they were spared the trip across the ditch to New Zealand!

I enjoy various forms of art and crafts, and when opportunities present I dabble in wildlife/outdoor photography. Check out a few of my better attempts in the photography section of this site!
