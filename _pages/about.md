I'm an ecologist and research scientist currently working as a postdoctoral research and teaching fellow at the University of Otago's Department of Marine Science (New Zealand). I have a wide-ranging interest in wildlife, pathogens and diseases, host-pathogen/microbe interactions, invasive species, genomics, diagnostics, and all things in between.

Originally hailing from Australia, I attained my undergraduate degree from the University of Queensland (Bachelor of Science with majors in Zoology and Marine Biology; awarded Dean's Commendation for High Achievement) with a research Honours year in freshwater pest fish ecology. I completed my PhD in UQ's School of Veterinary Science, investigating the molecular diversity, pathology and diagnosis of parasites causing mortality in sea turtle populations. This gave me the opportunity to work closely with veterinarians, parasitologists, conservation professionals, and geneticists, giving me a broad international network. I also have a Graduate Certificate in GIS (Geographic Information Science; awarded with Distinction) from Curtin University, Western Australia.

Research
======
My research aims to unravel the complex and critical interactions between wildlife and their microbiota — both harmful and beneficial — which have co-evolved with their hosts over time. These microbial communities play essential roles in host health, immunity, and adaptation. As the climate and ecosystems change, shifts in both pathogenic and symbiotic microbiota are expected, with profound implications for the health, resilience, and long-term evolution of wildlife populations. Genetic and genomic tools, combined with statistical/modelling, GIS, and collaborative veterinary investigations are the bedrock of my approach.

Since moving to New Zealand, I've spent several years working on a Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden-funded project in the Beck lab (Department of Zoology, University of Otago) exploring the role of bacterial microbiomes in enabling their host (the African clawed frog - <i>Xenopus laevis</i>) to regenerate tissue. I've since moved to the Fraser lab (Department of Marine Science) where I currently work on a variety of interesting projects using genetic and genomic data to investigate problems in the marine environments of New Zealand, the sub-Antarctic, and Antarctica. These include tracking kelp microbiomes and parasites in the sub-Antarctic and Antarctic regions, studying kelp recolonisation dynamics after heatwave-associated die-offs, and novel, highly sensitive diagnostic methods for parasitic infections in kororā (little/blue penguins).

I have skills and extensive training in bioinformatics, with advanced programming ability in R as well as experience and training in Bash, Python and SQL to complement well-developed analytic and statistics skills. Please check out the 'Coding' section of this website for some examples of my work - I especially enjoy data visualisation! I am experienced in using sequencing data (both Sanger and high throughput/next generation) to assess diversity and relationships of various taxa, characterise microbial communities, and design assays. In the wet lab, I have considerable expertise in all techniques associated with genetics including DNA extraction, PCR, library prep, CRISPR, and primer/assay design. In addition, I have a background in ecological consulting which brings a number of additional skills in project and budget management, impact assessment and mitigation, field surveys, reporting, collaboration, and communication/negotiation.

Teaching
======
I enjoy teaching in a variety of settings and am currently a teaching fellow for MARI301 - Marine Ecology and Ecosystems, a third year undergraduate course at the University of Otago. In this role, I develop and deliver lectures, workshops, and practicals, act as the primary contact point for our 100+ students, and perform a variety of administrative tasks (Blackboard site maintenance, marking, timetabling, etc) to ensure the smooth running of the course. I have had the opportunity to supervise and mentor a number of student research projects both in Australia and New Zealand. Before moving to New Zealand, I acted as a teaching assistant for various classroom, laboratory and field courses at the University of Queensland, in subjects including marine ecology, veterinary parasitology, animal biology, and 'One Health'. I also worked for decades as a horse-riding instructor, acquiring my first qualification at the age of 17 and teaching children, adults and special needs clients in individual and group settings, as well as running workshops and horse care training sessions.

Other Interests
======
On the weekends and holidays, I can usually be found outside. My wife and I are keen hikers and skiiers depending on the season, and New Zealand provides many ridiculously good-looking places to explore! I enjoy visiting the local bouldering gym before work, and was also a keen SCUBA diver - when I lived in a warmer climate :) In my younger years I was a keen competitive horse-rider, and still have a few old-timer equines enjoying retirement back home in Australia. Unlike our cat, they were spared the trip across the ditch to New Zealand!

I enjoy various forms of art and crafts, and when opportunities present I dabble in wildlife/outdoor photography. Check out a few of my better attempts in the photography section of this site!
