In 2025, I am a Teaching Fellow on MARI301 - Marine Ecology. MARI301 is a third year undergraduate course focused on the ecology of marine organisms, their interactions, biotic and abiotic factors that influence patterns and ecological processes in benthic and pelagic environments.

My responsibilities have included the following:

* Preparation and delivery of lectures:
  * Introduction to eDNA
  * Diseases in Marine Ecosystems
  * The Role of Microbes in Marine Ecosystems
* Development of content and curriculum items, workshops, and practicals
* Running field and computer practicals, classroom workshop sessions
* Course administration (primary point of contact for students, Blackboard site maintenance, timetabling, etc)
* Development and marking of assessments
