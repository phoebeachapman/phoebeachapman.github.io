MARI301 is a third year undergraduate course focused on the ecology of marine organisms, their interactions, biotic and abiotic factors that influence patterns and ecological processes in benthic and pelagic environments.

I contributed a lecture on environmental DNA (eDNA). This lecture was intended to provide an introduction to the theory behind eDNA and how it can be used in marine and environmental science, and provided practical examples of how these techniques are being used in New Zealand and overseas.
