GENE 360 is a third year undergraduate course primarily aimed at students who are likely to undertake postgraduate studies in Genetics. The major aims of the paper are to give students experience in what it is like to be a scientist. 

I contributed a lecture on career pathways as they related to my own experiences, providing examples of the research projects I have been involved in and detailing how I came to be involved with them.
