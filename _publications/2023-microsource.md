excerpt: 'Antibiotics are routinely used in <i>Xenopus</i> husbandry, yet bacteria play an important role in tissue regeneration. The first in-depth microbiome source and inheritance analysis for captive and non-antibiotic-treated <i>Xenopus laevis</i> suggests that vertical transmission plays an important role in establishing tadpole skin microbiomes, and should be considered in the context of colony husbandry and experimental regeneration studies.'

<b>Background</b> 
The amphibian skin microbiome has drawn interest due to the ecological threat posed by chytridiomycosis, which drives changes in symbiotic microbial communities and may be inhibited by certain bacterial taxa. However, skin microbes also play a role in amphibian tissue regeneration. <i>Xenopus</i> spp. are well-established model organisms used to study development, regeneration, genetics and disease. Husbandry protocols, including use of antibiotics and other sterilising agents, may affect experimental outcomes by altering microbiomes. It is therefore essential to improve our understanding of <i>Xenopus</i> microbiome characteristics and inheritance. We undertook bacterial 16S rRNA based sampling of a captive, closed <i>Xenopus laevis</i> colony. A total of 16 female frogs, their eggs, and tadpoles were sampled, covering multiple aquarium systems and tanks, along with testes from males used for in vitro fertilisation and a range of environmental samples.

<b>Results</b> 
Tank environments supported the most complex microbial communities. Mother frogs harboured the most diverse microbial communities of the frog life stages, with tadpole skin microbiomes being relatively simple. Frog samples were dominated by <i>Proteobacteria</i> and <i>Bacteroidota</i>. <i>Rhizobium</i> and <i>Chryseobacterium</i> were dominant in tadpoles, whereas mothers supported high proportions of <i>Vogesella</i> and <i>Acinetobacter</i> as well as <i>Chryseobacterium</i>. While the mothers’ habitats contained low levels of these taxa, the tadpole’s environmental microbes were very similar to those on tadpole skin. A total of 34 genera were found to be differentially abundant between the mothers and tadpoles. Analysis of Bray-Curtis distances indicated that mother and tadpole microbiomes varied according to the mothers’ aquarium system, the tanks within them, and the individual mother. Source tracking analyses showed that egg jelly and tadpoles received a mean of approximately two thirds of their microbiomes via vertical transmission, although a sizeable proportion came from unknown sources at all life stages.

<b>Conclusions</b> 
The skin of mother frogs appears to select for certain taxa that are otherwise present at low abundances in the environment. While tadpoles inherit a proportion of their microbiomes from their mothers via the egg, they support a distinct and less diverse microbial community than adult frogs. The microbiome varies between individual mothers, and is also affected by the aquarium system and individual tank within that the mother occupies.
