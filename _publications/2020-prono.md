The superfamily Pronocephaloidea Looss, 1899 comprises digeneans occurring in the gut and respiratory organs of fishes, turtles, marine iguanas, birds and mammals. Although many life cycles are known for species of the Notocotylidae LÃ¼he, 1909 maturing in birds and mammals, relatively few are known for the remaining pronocephaloid lineages. We report the cercariae of five pronocephaloid species from marine gastropods of the Queensland coast, Australia. From Lizard Island, northern Great Barrier Reef, we report three cercariae, two from <i>Rhinoclavis vertagus</i> (Cerithiidae) and one from <i>Nassarius coronatus</i> (Nassariidae). From Moreton Bay, southern Queensland, an additional two cercariae are reported from two genotypes of the gastropod worm shell <i>Thylacodes</i> sp. (Vermetidae). Phylogenetic analysis using 28S rRNA gene sequences shows all five species are nested within the Pronocephaloidea, but not matching or particularly close to any previously sequenced taxon. In combination, phylogenetic and ecological evidence suggests that most of these species will prove to be pronocephalids parasitic in marine turtles. The Vermetidae is a new host family for the Pronocephaloidea.
