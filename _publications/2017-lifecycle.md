Blood flukes of the family Spirorchiidae are significant pathogens of both free-ranging and captive marine turtles. Despite a significant proportion of marine turtle mortality being attributable to spirorchiid infections, details of their life cycles remain almost entirely unknown. Here we report on the molecular elucidation of the complete life cycle of a marine spirorchiid, identified as <i>Amphiorchis</i> sp., infecting vermetid gastropods and captive hatched neonate <i>Caretta caretta</i> in the Oceanogràfic Aquarium, in Valencia, Spain. Specimens of a vermetid gastropod, <i>Thylaeodus cf. rugulosus</i> (Monterosato, 1878), collected from the aquarium filtration system housing diseased <i>C. caretta</i>, were infected with sporocysts and cercariae consistent with the family Spirorchiidae. We generated rDNA sequence data [internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and partial 28S rDNA] from infections from the vermetid which were identical to sequences generated from eggs from the serosa of the intestine of neonate <i>C. caretta</i>, and an adult spirorchiid from the liver of a <i>C. caretta</i> from Florida, USA. Given the reliability of these markers in the delineation of trematode species, we consider all three stages to represent the same species and tentatively identify it as a species of <i>Amphiorchis</i> Price, 1934. The source of infection at the Oceanogràfic Foundation Rehabilitation Centre, Valencia, Spain, is inferred to be an adult <i>C. caretta</i> from the western Mediterranean being rehabilitated in the same facility. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that this <i>Amphiorchis</i> sp. is closely related to other spirorchiids of marine turtles (species of <i>Carettacola</i> Manter & Larson, 1950, <i>Hapalotrema</i> Looss, 1899 and <i>Learedius</i> Price, 1934). We discuss implications of the present findings for the control of spirorchiidiasis in captivity, for the better understanding of epidemiology in wild individuals, and the elucidation of further life cycles.
