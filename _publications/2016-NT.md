The spirorchiid digenean '<i>Hapalotrema synorchis</i>' was recovered from the heart of a juvenile Hawksbill Turtle ('<i>Eretmochelys imbricata</i>') found deceased on a local Darwin beach. The turtle was in poor condition, showing many characteristics associated with spirorchiid infection. A second necropsied turtle showed signs of infection with spirorchiids but adult specimens were not recovered. Examination of specimens held at the Berrimah Veterinary Laboratory found another '<i>E. imbricata</i>' infected with '<i>H. synorchis</i>' and a Green Turtle ('<i>Chelonia mydas</i>') infected with the related '<i>H. postorchis</i>'. Despite previous reports of infected turtles, this is the first confirmed identification of '<i>H. synorchis</i>' and '<i>H. postorchis</i>' from Northern Territory waters.
