<b>On July 31st I was lucky enough to present the latest in the Department of Marine Science's regular seminar series!

I spoke about my trip with the Sir Peter Blake Trust, the Royal New Zealand Navy and the Department of Conservation to the sub-Antarctic islands in March - see [this news post](https://phoebeachapman.github.io/posts/2025/03/14/blake/) for more details on that, and my [photography site](https://phoebeachapman.github.io/photography/) for pictures!

This was the first since our recent move to the Geology building on campus - the use of the common room instead of a formal seminar room made for a nice relaxed atmosphere. It was also great to see several familiar faces from the trip in attendance as well as family and friends on Zoom!
