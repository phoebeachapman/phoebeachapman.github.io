<b>We've just returned from the 2025 Blake Expedition to sub-Antarctic Campbell Island and the Auckland Islands</b>

The Sir Peter Blake Trust (BLAKE) was established to inspire young New Zealanders to care for the environment through activities and adventures that encourage environmental awareness and leadership, and instill a deeper sense of kaitiakitanga (environmental stewardship) within them. The BLAKE Expedition offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for students and teachers to join a team exploring remote and environmentally significant areas across Aotearoa New Zealand, engaging in scientific research and learning from scientists and environmental leaders.

This year, I was privileged to have the opportunity to join the BLAKE Expedition as one of the expedition scientists, undertaking research with assistance from Blake's hand-picked crew of students and teachers. The Expedition took place as part of Operation Endurance, a collaboration between the New Zealand Navy and the Department of Conservation to undertake maintenance and other activities at this far-flung location. We also had other groups on board including NgƒÅi Tahu, MetService, and Defence Science and Technology, as well as Army and Airforce, making for a varied and interesting crowd! Heading south from Bluff on the HMNZS Canterbury, we were lucky enough to have predominantly decent weather, which allowed us to visit Enderby and Auckland Islands (within the Auckland Islands group), and to spend four days working on Campbell Island still further south. My scientific work involved collecting samples of kelp-associated microbes and corresponding environmental samples as part of a project comparing kelp (Bull kelp/rimurapa - <i>Duvillaea antarctica</i> and giant kelp <i>Macrocystis pyrifera<i> microbiomes in sub-Antarctic locations around the world, and also looking for signs of disease. We successfully surveyed at four different sites, although it was hard not to be distracted by the wildlife: hundreds of Southern Royal albatross, sea lions, elephant seals, penguins, and other species unique to these isolated islands. Aside from the wildlife, I was so impressed with the bright and enthusiastic students that took to the various science projects like ducks (or Campbell Island teals??) to water, as well as the teachers who were our right-hand ladies and will continue to play such an important role in taking our messages home to their schools.

I would like to thank all involved in the 2025 BLAKE Expedition for the opportunity! Aside from being able to experience and work in such a unique part of the world, it was a once in a lifetime chance to participate in such a collaborative mission and to experience life on a Navy ship.
